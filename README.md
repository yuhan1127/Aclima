Project Title: Examining the Association between Socioeconomic Status (SES) and Air Pollution in Alameda County

Researcher: Yunbi Nam, Sirui Liu, **Yuhan Wang**, Wenbo Zhang, University of Washington

Sponsored: Aclima, Inc. (San Francisco, CA)

Project objective: Connect Aclimaâ€™s hyperlocal air quality data to neighborhood-level measures of demographic factors such as income, education, race/ethnicity, and age that are available from the Census Bureau. The goal will be to learn about differential levels of air pollution exposure for different population groups. These findings will provide important insights into environmental inequality and environmental justice, crucially important fields of interest to UW researchers and with direct environmental policy implications.
